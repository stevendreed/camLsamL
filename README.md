# camLsamL

Playground for all this SAML 2.0!

## Overview
SAML (1, 1.1 and 2.0) is an XML-based[1] fit to the task of exchanging security (mainly authentication) information between web applications.

## Repo goals
o Centralize reference materials for SAML, including SAMLbinding and third-party summaries/tutorials

o Flask applications to pass assertions between each other

o a NoSQL db to store secured user information for testing

o an implementation of SAML assertions and binds to authenticate a user between these flask applications
